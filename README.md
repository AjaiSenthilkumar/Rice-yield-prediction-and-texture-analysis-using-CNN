**#🌾 Rice Yield Prediction and Texture Analysis using CNN and OpenCV**
This project uses Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to analyze rice grain images and predict yield and texture quality. A user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter allows users to upload rice grain images, and the system predicts the grain texture category and provides insights for yield prediction.

🔄 How It Works (Code Process Explanation)
1. Image Preprocessing (OpenCV)
The input rice grain image is first converted to grayscale.

Thresholding or segmentation techniques are applied to isolate grains.

Resize the image to fit the input size of the CNN model (e.g., 64x64 or 128x128).

Normalize pixel values to range [0,1].

2. Texture Classification (CNN)
A Convolutional Neural Network is trained using a labeled dataset of rice grain images categorized by texture (e.g., Fine, Medium, Coarse).

The model architecture typically consists of:

Conv2D + ReLU + MaxPooling

Multiple hidden layers

Flatten + Dense layers

Softmax for classification output

Once trained, the model predicts the texture category for the uploaded image.

3. Yield Prediction Logic
Each texture category is mapped to a typical yield range (based on agricultural studies or training data).

Example:

Fine texture → High yield

Medium texture → Moderate yield

Coarse texture → Low yield

Yield insights are generated based on this logic and displayed to the user.

4. Tkinter GUI
Simple Python GUI with buttons:

Upload Image

Analyze

Show Result

Image is displayed on the canvas, and the predicted class and yield insights are shown.
